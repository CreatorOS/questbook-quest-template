# Open Sourced Assessable Education Specification (OSAES)

This specification enables any git project to be turned into a learning material. Learners can start learning from real life projects when the project authors attach a `Learn` section to their project. 

To create a `Learn` section, all the project owner needs to do is create a `LEARN.md` file. 
`LEARN.md` file has a specific format. Once adhered to, other projects can crawl Git repos to make the tutorials discoverable.

You can create a `LEARN.md` file now for your github project and it will start featuring on various LEARN Clients.

For specifications of the `LEARN.md` file visit the sample [LEARN.md](./LEARN.md) file in this repo.
